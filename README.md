## What's Spring?
Essentially Spring is a framework for [Inversion of Control (IoC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control), and usually it comes with the use of the pattern of [Dependecy Injection (DI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection).

Spring can make our projects development way more easy and fast, and in this short guide we'll see Spring in action while creating some REST responses.

## What's IoC?
In software engineering, **Inversion of Control (IoC)** is a programming principle. It does just like the name says, it *inverts* the flow of control. In the regular flow of the program, the custom code calls the library to resolve generic tasks, but with inversion of control, it is the framework that calls into the custom, or task-specific code.

## What's DI?
[Dependency Injection (DI)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-intro-to-dependency-injection-what-it-is-and-when-to-use-it-7578c84fa88f/) is a IoC technique in wich an object receives other object that it depends on. These other objects are called dependencies.
